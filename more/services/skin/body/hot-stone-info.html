	<h1>Hot Stone Therapy</h1>
	
	<p>Hot stone therapy promotes harmony and balance within the body, mind and soul. It has become one of the most popular treatments within Spas and Salons across the world. </p>
	<p>Hot stone therapy accelerates the blood circulation to muscle tissue, increases oxygenation, reduces inflammation, aids in the elimination of metabolic wastes, boosts the immune system and has an overall toning effect on the internal organs. </p>
	<p>The benefits of Hot Stone Therapy extend to client and therapist alike. The incredible combination of Swedish technique massage and the pleasant heat of the basalt stones invite the client to sink into a profound state of relaxation in a matter of minutes. This is extremely significant in our fast-paced and often stressful lives. </p>
	<p>When the mind relaxes, the body is quick to follow. Through the warmth of the stones we bring nature into our treatment rooms. It's a great opportunity to connect with Mother Earth. Take your time and rest in her healing arms. </p>
