				<p><strong>Eyelash Extensions are not for everyone</strong><br />
				This is a very high maintenance beauty treatment. It requires very gentle care in order for the lashes to last long and stay in good condition. Once the lashes are attached you must not rub or pull on them. You must not wear any mascara or use Eyelash curlers.
				</p>

				<p><strong>What are Eyelash Extensions?</strong><br />
				Eyelash Extensions are individual Synthetic material. They are attached to your Eyelash individually not to the skin. Each synthetic lash is attached to an eyelash. It is a very enhancing beauty service and you DO NOT need to use any Mascara while wearing these Eyelash extensions. It is a very careful and intense service which requires skill and precision. Once applied these lashes are so natural looking it is difficult to tell even up close that you have extensions on. Size availability ranges from short to long.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>How long do the eyelashes last?</strong><br />
				It is an individual process. We lose one Eyelash almost every day. We also grow a new lash to replace the one that fell out. These Lashes can stay on up to 2 full Months with proper care and bi-weekly maintenance. However, factors such as eyelash growth, lifestyle and general after care will affect how long the lashes last. They can be easily removed. Please do not attempt to remove any lashes on your own, seek professional help from your technician. <strong>WE WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT YOU MAY CAUSE BY TRYING TO REMOVE THE EYELASH EXTENSIONS ON YOUR OWN</strong>.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>Do the False Eyelashes damage my natural Eyelashes?</strong><br />
				No, not at all! The lash adhesive is formulated to create a solid bond, specifically for human lashes. The adhesive dries very soft on the lashes, allowing the lashes to stay flexible and bouncy just like your own lashes.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>Before your Appointment</strong><br />
				Remove all eye makeup and clean your lashes. Make sure to arrive with a clean and dry face. If you are a contact lens wearer, please remove contact lenses and wear glasses to your appointment, or bring a lens case and remove them when you arrive at your appointment. Plan to set aside 1 to 2.5 hours for your appointment. Some of our clients fall asleep during the procedure.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Do not perm or Tint lashes before or after lash extension application. </li>
					<li>Do not use a regular Eyelash curler. </li>
					<li>Do not rub your eyes or lashes when washing your face. Clean around the Eyes with a wash cloth. </li>
					<li>Do not pull your lash extensions, as it will take out your own lash as well. </li>
					<li>Do not go in a Sauna while wearing Eyelash extensions.</li>
					<li>Do not use Mascara </li>
					<li>Do not try to remove the Extensions on your own. </li>
					<li>Do not cut the Extensions (you may cut your own lashes)</li>
					<li>Clean your eye makeup without touching the Extensions</li>
					<li>Remember to come in for touch ups. </li>
				</ol>
				
				<p><strong>What happens if a lash should loosen or become dislodged?</strong><br />
				Do not pull on the lash. Please contact your technician to make an appointment to have them removed or replaced, to avoid damage to your natural lash. As your natural lashes fall out due to the growth cycle, you will need refills when new lashes grow. At first you may find you need a refill every 2 weeks.  As you become accustomed to the extensions and with a little practice maintaining the lashes, the time between refills can be extended to 3 weeks.
