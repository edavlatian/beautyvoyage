			<h1>A natural moisturiser in the form of a light foam texture for beautiful and healthy feet.</h1>
			
			<p><strong>Allpresan</strong>, the original foot care foam product, was introduced to foot care 
			professionals in the mid 1990s. With over 10 years of proven results, the product line has 
			expanded to include solutions for use at home.</p>
			
			<p>The patented formulation of the foot care foams have a unique advantage: during application 
			they form a two-dimensional, two-phase net structure which strengthens the skin's protective 
			function without clogging pores. Since there is no heat accumulation, the natural functions 
			of the skin are not impaired; the skin is allowed to breath, which is especially 
			important for sensitive skin.</p>
			
			<p>Allpresan offers a product range that features various percentages of urea - 5%, 10% or 
			15% - for varying degrees of skin dryness.</p>

			<h2>Urea, the body's own natural humectant</h2>
			
			<p>Urea, also referred to as Carbamide, is the main ingredient in Allpresan's product line. 
			Non-allergenic and antibacterial, urea is a natural moisturiser secreted by our own cells. 
			Urea plays an important role in the health of the epidermis. A sample of 100 g of human 
			skin contains normally 1,42 g of Urea and interestingly, about 7% of our natural 
			moisturising comes from Urea.</p>	
			
			<p>Using Urea in the Allpresan Pedicare line has the advantage of offering 
			odourless, 
			colourless, hypoallergenic, antibacterial properties for various foot conditions. 
			This ingredient is suitable for the most sensitive skin and is recommended for 
			irritated skin, psoriasis and persons with diabetes. The application is simple and 
			efficient thanks to its foam texture.</p>
			
			<h2>Urea's important functions for the skin:</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>increases the water content of the stratum corneum and thus makes the skin soft</li>
				<li>stabilises the skin's barrier and defence functions</li>
				<li>improves the regenerative ability of the epidermal barrier</li>
				<li>relieves itchiness</li>
				<li>loosens the stratum corneum</li>
				<li>accelerates natural exfoliation and avoids thickening of the skin</li>			
			</ul>
